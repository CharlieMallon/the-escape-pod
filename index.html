            <article>The article tag defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. It does not necessarily mean a “blog post.” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various contexts.</article>
            <section>Using section is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs from an article tag. It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else. </section>
            <aside>An aside element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information.</aside>
